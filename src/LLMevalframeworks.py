There's a frisbee stuck high up in a tree and your ladder is broken. Tools available: fishing line, a tennis ball, a water bottle, a broom handle, a raincoat, a beach towel, sunglasses and a book. However, the frisbee is stuck at a height beyond the reach of the broom handle and you can't throw the tennis ball high enough. How can you get the frisbee down?
[The End of User's Problem]

[The Start of Assistant's Answer]
Step 1 of the solution is:  Tie the fishing line to the end of the broom handle, creating a longer reach. Step 2 of the solution is:  Attach the tennis ball to the end of the fishing line. Step 3 of the solution is:  Fill the water bottle with a little water, put on the sunglasses, wrap the towel around the broom handle and soak the towel with water from the bottle. Step 4 of the solution is:  Use the wet towel to create a whip-like motion with the broom handle, propelling the tennis ball high enough to snag the frisbee. Step 5 of the solution is:  Secure the book to the fishing line to increase the weight and improve the accuracy of the tennis ball launch. Step 6 of the solution is:  Use the raincoat as a makeshift parachute for the tennis ball, allowing for a controlled descent and easier retrieval of the frisbee. Step 7 of the solution is:  Fashion a hook from the book's pages and use it to snag the frisbee. Step 8 of the solution is:  Tie the fishing line to the hook and use the whip-like motion to retrieve the frisbee. Step 9 of the solution is:  Attach the hook to a kite, fly the kite high enough to reach the frisbee, and use the fishing line to reel in the frisbee.  Step 10 of the solution is:  Build a small kite out of the raincoat and book pages, attach the fishing line to the kite, and fly it high enough to reach and retrieve the frisbee.

There's a frisbee stuck high up in a tree and your ladder is broken. Tools available: fishing line, a tennis ball, a water bottle, a broom handle, a raincoat, a beach towel, sunglasses and a book. However, the frisbee is stuck at a height beyond the reach of the broom handle and you can't throw the tennis ball high enough. How can you get the frisbee down?
[The End of User's Problem]

[The Start of Assistant's Answer]
Step 1 of the solution is:  Tie the fishing line to the end of the broom handle, creating a longer reach. Step 2 of the solution is:  Attach the tennis ball to the end of the fishing line. Step 3 of the solution is:  Fill the water bottle with a little water, put on the sunglasses, wrap the towel around the broom handle and soak the towel with water from the bottle. Step 4 of the solution is:  Use the wet towel to create a whip-like motion with the broom handle, propelling the tennis ball high enough to snag the frisbee. Step 5 of the solution is:  Secure the book to the fishing line to increase the weight and improve the accuracy of the tennis ball launch. Step 6 of the solution is:  Use the raincoat as a makeshift parachute for the tennis ball, allowing for a controlled descent and easier retrieval of the frisbee. Step 7 of the solution is:  Fashion a hook from the book's pages and use it to snag the frisbee. Step 8 of the solution is:  Tie the fishing line to the hook and use the whip-like motion to retrieve the frisbee. Step 9 of the solution is:  Attach the hook to a kite, fly the kite high enough to reach the frisbee, and use the fishing line to reel in the frisbee.  Step 10 of the solution is:  Build a small kite out of the raincoat and book pages, attach the fishing line to the kite, and fly it high enough to reach and retrieve the frisbee.
