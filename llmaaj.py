- A solution is Effective if the solution, as presented in the response, is able to FULLY resolve the issue faced by the user.
- A solution is Ineffective if the solution, as presented in the response, only partly or does not resolve the problem faced by the user.
Provide a 20 word summary of reasons so as to why the response is Effective or Ineffective.
After this, provide your final judgement as follows:

[The Start of User's Problem]
Some potted plants on your windowsill have dried out due to lack of water, but you don't have a watering can at hand. Tools available to you include a bottle of mouthwash, a pair of tongs, a roll of bubble wrap, a soup ladle, a TV remote, a tube of toothpaste, a roll of aluminum foil, and a wad of plastic grocery bags, a jar of pickles, a ping pong ball, a rubber band, and a wooden spatula. The constraint is that the soup ladle has a number of holes and can't hold the water. How to water the potted plants using only these items?
[The End of User's Problem]

[The Start of Assistant's Answer]
Step1: Empty the mouthwash bottle and rinse well. <br>
Step2: Fill the cleaned mouthwash bottle with water. <br>
Step3: Use the mouthwash bottle to water the potted plants. 
[The End of Assistant's Answer]

The mouthwash bottle is able to water the plants, thereby solving the drying out of the plants. [[10]]
